# Retool RPC client packages

[Retool RPC](https://docs.retool.com/docs/retool-rpc) (Remote Procedure Call) is a fast, secure solution for connecting your codebase to Retool. You define functions in your backend and then call them from Retool apps using a Retool RPC [resource](https://docs.retool.com/data-sources/concepts/resources#resources).

Retool provides [JavaScript](https://github.com/tryretool/retoolrpc/tree/main/javascript) and [Python](https://github.com/tryretool/retoolrpc/tree/main/python) client packages. These packages serve as the client-side component for the `retoolrpc` project.

## Get started

See the [Retool RPC](https://docs.retool.com/docs/retool-rpc) documentation to get started. If you're ready to install one of the client packages, see the instructions for [JavaScript](https://github.com/tryretool/retoolrpc/tree/main/javascript) or [Python](https://github.com/tryretool/retoolrpc/tree/main/python).
